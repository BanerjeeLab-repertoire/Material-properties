# Passive microrheology Analysis
This program analyzes the trajectories of a trapped particle inside an optical tweezer to obtain the rheological moduli G' and G'' of the surrounding medium. The calculation is done following the works of Tassieri et al. see the references below:

This program is published as a part of associated code for the manuscript "*Programmable Viscoelasticity in Protein-RNA Condensates with Disordered Sticker-Spacer Polypeptides*" by Alshareedah and coworkers.
